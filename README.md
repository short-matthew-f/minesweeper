# minesweeper.rb

An implementation of the classic game Minesweeper in ruby.

## to play

`ruby minesweeper.rb` will start the game.  at any time you can `(q)`uit out of the game and it will save the state for you.  `(l)`oad on start will reload your save state, if any.

## what we've accomplished

minesweeper.rb has:

- Unicode support to make the board look nice
- Error handling to avoid borking out due to ornery users
- Multiple classes interacting nicely with appropriate side effects
